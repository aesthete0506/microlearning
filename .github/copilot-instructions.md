# Microlearning App

This is a TikTok/Reels-style microlearning application built with:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **CSS Modules** for styling with smooth animations

## Project Structure
- `src/components/` - React components (Feed, ContentCard, DomainSelector)
- `src/data/` - Content data and domain information
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Key Features
- Smooth vertical scroll snapping like TikTok/Reels
- Domain-based content filtering (AI, Finance, Health, etc.)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, j/k)

## Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Maintain smooth 60fps animations
- Test on mobile viewports
